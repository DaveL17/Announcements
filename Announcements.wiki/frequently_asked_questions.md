## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why won't you support [Insert Speech Tool Here]?  
  Rather than try to be inclusive or worry about leaving some tool out of the equation, the plugin only offers the 
  "direct" Indigo speech hook; allowing for some speech facility to be offered. The plugin is designed to support the 
  construction of complex announcement strings rather than their actual speech.

### I Changed my default voice in OS X, but the change doesn't take effect. What Gives?
  To change the default speaking voice, go to System Preferences → Accessibility → Spoken Content and select your
  preferred voice. Note: this is the Accessibility setting, not the Apple Intelligence & Siri voice settings. After
  changing the voice, restart the Indigo server for the change to take effect. If the voice still doesn't change after
  restarting the server, try rebooting your system.

### Does the Announcements Plugin work with Emoji?  
  It does. (At least with Apple's built-in speech synthesizer that is). The announcement text "This is a 🔴 emoji." 
  results in the announcement, "This is a red circle emoji." Your mileage may vary with other speech tools, so it's 
  best to test an announcement or two before deciding to include emoji in your announcements.
