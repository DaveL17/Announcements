# README.md

The Menu Items folder can be used to provide links to individual scripts on the Indigo Plugin menu. The script will be 
placed at the bottom of the menu. For example, a file called test.py will be displayed as "Test" on the plugin menu.

This README.md file will not be displayed on the menu.
